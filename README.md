# Trivializer

## Purpose
A timed quiz that gives users a way to kill boredom, unwind, or have a 'tech happy hour', supplying each player with a delightful experience and a strong sense of control. The user picks a genre out of 8 possible choices (between movies, science, history, sports, music, television, books and geography), then chooses a difficulty setting (between easy, medium, and hard). The user is then presented with 15 consecutive questions, and 10 seconds to answer each one. At the end of each round, the player gets a final score reviewable on a dashboard.

## This Version
This is the first version of this application, made specifically for the first group project of U of T's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Time was limited and there were a few ideas that had to be put in the 'ice box' until a future version can be developed. Some of those desires included giving the user the ability to choose more than one genre per game. Another element would be opening things up for multiple players' scores to be able to be stored in a database. Also, it would be ideal to give the user the option to adjust the timer countdown. These and more extra features would add to the user's potential to tailor-make a trivia quiz to their exact specifications.
